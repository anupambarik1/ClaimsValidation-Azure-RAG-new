INJURY DETAILS
On December 20, 2023, I slipped on ice in my driveway and fell directly onto my right shoulder. I experienced immediate severe pain and loss of range of motion. MRI performed on December 28, 2023, confirmed a partial thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon (approximately 40% tear) with associated impingement.

Dr. Stevens recommended a trial of conservative treatment with physical therapy before considering surgical intervention. Treatment goals include:
1. Reduce pain and inflammation
2. Restore range of motion
3. Strengthen rotator cuff muscles
4. Improve shoulder stability
5. Return to activities of daily living
