Provider NPI: 6547893210
Facility: Caribbean Wellness Resort, Mexico
Diagnosis Code: E66.01 (Morbid obesity due to excess calories)
Procedure Codes: 43644 (Laparoscopic gastric bypass), 99223 (Hospital care)

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:
Patient traveled to Mexico for bariatric surgery (gastric bypass) at medical tourism facility. Patient BMI: 38 (below policy threshold of 40 for bariatric coverage). No documented supervised weight loss program participation. Surgery performed at non-US facility.

CLAIM AMOUNT: $18,900.00

ITEMIZED CHARGES:
- Bariatric surgeon fee: $9,500.00
- Hospital stay (3 days): $4,200.00
- Anesthesia: $2,800.00
- Post-operative care: $1,200.00
- Medications and supplies: $1,200.00
TOTAL: $18,900.00

REASON FOR DENIAL:
1. SERVICES OUTSIDE UNITED STATES: Policy only covers emergency services outside US. Elective surgery in Mexico not covered.

2. NO PRE-AUTHORIZATION: Bariatric surgery requires pre-authorization. None obtained. Pre-auth would have been denied based on criteria below.

3. MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA NOT MET:
   - BMI 38 (policy requires BMI ≥40 or BMI ≥35 with comorbidities)
   - No documentation of serious weight-related comorbidities
   - No evidence of supervised 6-month weight loss program
   - No psychological evaluation completed
   - No nutritional counseling documented

4. EXPERIMENTAL/MEDICAL TOURISM: Services obtained at non-accredited foreign facility. Policy excludes experimental or unproven treatments and requires US-accredited facilities.

POLICY VIOLATIONS:
✗ Services performed outside US (non-emergency)
✗ No pre-authorization obtained
✗ BMI below policy threshold (38 vs required 40)
✗ No supervised weight loss program (6 months required)
✗ No psychological evaluation
✗ No nutritional counseling
✗ Foreign facility not accredited by US standards

CLAIM STATUS: Should be DENIED
Denial Codes:
- D1: Services outside US (non-emergency)
- D2: No pre-authorization
- D3: Medical necessity criteria not met
- D4: BMI below policy requirement
- D5: Required supervised weight loss program not completed
- D6: Non-accredited facility

MEMBER FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: $18,900.00 (100%)

APPEAL RIGHTS:
Member may appeal within 180 days. However, fundamental exclusions (out-of-country elective surgery, no pre-auth, criteria not met) make successful appeal unlikely.

NOTES:
Even if services had been performed in US at in-network facility, claim would still be denied for failure to meet bariatric surgery criteria (BMI threshold, supervised weight loss program, psychological evaluation).
