REQUIRED DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED:
✓ Death certificate (lists suicide as manner of death)
✓ Medical examiner's report
✓ Toxicology report
✓ Police investigation report
✓ Suicide note (photocopy)
✓ Psychiatric hospital records (November 2023)
✓ Psychiatrist treatment records
✓ Prescription history
✓ Primary care physician records

REASON FOR DENIAL:
1. SUICIDE WITHIN 2-YEAR EXCLUSION PERIOD: Policy provision explicitly states death by suicide within first 2 years results in premium refund only.

2. MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATION ON APPLICATION: Insured deliberately concealed:
   - Recent psychiatric hospitalization for suicide attempt
   - Active treatment for severe depression
   - Multiple prescription psychotropic medications
   - Ongoing suicidal ideation

3. FRAUD/CONCEALMENT: Evidence suggests Jennifer applied for insurance knowing she had suicidal ideation and concealed this to obtain coverage. Application submitted during active psychiatric treatment.

POLICY LANGUAGE (Suicide Clause):
"If the insured dies by suicide, while sane or insane, within two years from the policy date, our liability will be limited to a return of premiums paid."

CLAIM STATUS: DENIED
Denial Reason: Death by suicide within contestability period

REFUND TO BENEFICIARY:
Total Premiums Paid: $255.00 (3 monthly payments of $85)
Refund Amount: $255.00
Death Benefit: $0.00

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:
Had death occurred after 2-year contestability period, even by suicide, claim would have been paid. However, material misrepresentation on application would still allow company to rescind policy for fraud.

The concealment of psychiatric hospitalization and active mental health treatment constitutes material misrepresentation. Had company known true health status, policy would have been declined or issued with exclusion/higher premium.

BENEFICIARY NOTIFICATION:
David Williams notified of denial. Refund of $255.00 processed.

APPEAL RIGHTS:
Beneficiary may appeal, but suicide exclusion within 2 years is absolute and enforceable in all states. Material misrepresentation provides additional grounds for denial.

LEGAL REVIEW:
Company legal department reviewed. Denial upheld. Suicide clause enforceable. Material misrepresentation documented.
