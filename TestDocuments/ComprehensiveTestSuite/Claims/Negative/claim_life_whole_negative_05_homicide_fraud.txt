CRIMINAL CHARGES:
Defendant: Angela Johnson
Charges: First-degree murder
Status: Pending trial
Prosecution Theory: Angela murdered Marcus for $250,000 life insurance proceeds
Defense Theory: Self-defense during domestic violence

INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:
1. BENEFICIARY AS PERPETRATOR: Primary beneficiary charged with murdering insured.

2. SUSPICIOUS TIMING: 
   - Policy issued January 10, 2024
   - Marcus dead 67 days later
   - Suspiciously short time between policy issue and death

3. FINANCIAL MOTIVE:
   - Couple had significant debts ($85,000 credit cards, behind on mortgage)
   - Angela initiated life insurance application
   - Policy application submitted just weeks after couple researched "life insurance payouts" online

4. PREMEDITATION EVIDENCE:
   - Angela purchased handgun 2 weeks before death
   - Search history showed "how long until life insurance pays" and "contestability period"
   - Text messages to friend mentioning "things will be better soon"

5. SLAYER STATUTE APPLICABLE: Oregon law (and policy provision) prohibits beneficiary who intentionally causes insured's death from receiving proceeds.

POLICY PROVISION (Slayer Clause):
"If a beneficiary is convicted of intentionally causing the death of the insured, that beneficiary shall forfeit all rights to policy proceeds. Benefits will be paid to contingent beneficiaries or estate."

ADDITIONAL APPLICATION REVIEW:
Routine contestability investigation revealed potential issues:
- Medical records show Marcus treated for stage 2 lung cancer 18 months before application
- Application Question 12: "Have you ever been diagnosed with or treated for cancer?"
- Marcus's Answer: NO
- Truth: YES - Non-small cell lung cancer, completed treatment, in remission
- Chest X-rays from 16 months ago show cancerous lesion and treatment

REASON FOR DENIAL:
1. SLAYER STATUTE: Primary beneficiary (Angela Johnson) charged with intentional murder of insured. Under Oregon Slayer Statute and policy provision, beneficiary who murders insured cannot profit from crime.

2. MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATION (Additional Ground): Marcus concealed cancer history on application. Had company known of cancer diagnosis, policy would have been declined or issued with exclusion/rated premium.

3. CONTESTABILITY PERIOD: Death within first 2 years allows full underwriting review. Cancer misrepresentation discovered during investigation.

4. POLICY RESCISSION: Company exercising right to rescind policy ab initio (from the beginning) due to material misrepresentation.

CLAIM STATUS: DENIED
Primary Denial Reason: Slayer Statute - Beneficiary caused insured's death
Secondary Denial Reason: Material misrepresentation - Policy rescinded

CONTINGENT BENEFICIARIES:
Tyler Johnson (son) and Maya Johnson (daughter) would normally receive proceeds, but policy rescinded due to material misrepresentation by insured.

REFUND:
Premiums Paid: $1,275.00
Refund To: Estate of Marcus Johnson (not Angela)
Refund Amount: $1,275.00
Death Benefit: $0.00

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS:
- Criminal trial pending against Angela Johnson
- Civil claim filed by children (Tyler and Maya) challenging denial
- Company position: Rescission valid regardless of slayer statute
- Forensic underwriting completed
- All medical providers contacted and confirmed cancer treatment

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS:
1. If Angela acquitted: Slayer statute would not apply, but material misrepresentation still grounds for rescission.
2. If Angela convicted: Slayer statute applies, proceeds would go to children, BUT policy still rescinded for fraud.
3. If no misrepresentation: Slayer statute would apply, Angela denied, children would receive $250,000.

FINAL DETERMINATION: CLAIM DENIED - POLICY RESCINDED
- No death benefit payable
- Premium refund of $1,275 to estate (not Angela)
- Policy void ab initio due to material misrepresentation
- Slayer statute provides additional grounds for denying Angela's claim

APPEAL RIGHTS:
Estate may appeal rescission decision. However, cancer diagnosis documented in medical records constitutes clear material misrepresentation. Policy would not have been issued with knowledge of recent cancer.
