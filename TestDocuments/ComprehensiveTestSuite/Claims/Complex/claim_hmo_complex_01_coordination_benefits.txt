COORDINATION OF BENEFITS COMPLEXITY:
Michael turned 65 on May 1, 2024 and enrolled in Medicare Part B, making Medicare primary and HMO secondary. However, he continued working and maintained employer-sponsored HMO coverage.

COORDINATION OF BENEFITS RULES:
Age 65+ with Employer Coverage:
- If employer has <20 employees: Medicare is primary
- If employer has ≥20 employees: Employer plan is primary

Michael's Employer Size: 75 employees
Therefore: HMO is PRIMARY, Medicare is SECONDARY

MEDICARE PAYMENT (Secondary):
Medicare allowable amount: $11,200.00
Medicare paid (as secondary): $2,240.00 (20% after HMO payment)
EOB received from Medicare

EXPECTED HMO PAYMENT (Primary):
Total charges: $14,750.00
HMO negotiated rate (in-network): $12,800.00
Applied to deductible: $1,500.00 (annual deductible - now met)
Remaining: $11,300.00
HMO pays 90%: $10,170.00
Patient coinsurance (10%): $1,130.00

COORDINATION CALCULATION:
HMO payment (primary): $10,170.00
Medicare payment (secondary): $2,240.00
Total insurance payments: $12,410.00
Patient responsibility: $1,500 (deductible) + $1,130 (coinsurance) - $2,240 (Medicare) = $390.00

COMPLEXITY FACTORS:
1. Coordination of Benefits between employer plan and Medicare
2. Determining primary vs secondary payer (employer size rule)
3. Medicare allowable amounts vs HMO negotiated rates
4. Proper claims processing sequence
5. Patient turning 65 mid-year (dual coverage scenario)
