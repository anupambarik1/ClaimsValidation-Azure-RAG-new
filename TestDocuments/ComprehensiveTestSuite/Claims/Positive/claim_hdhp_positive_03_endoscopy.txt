DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:
Patient Robert Chen is a 34-year-old male with a 6-month history of persistent gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms including severe heartburn, regurgitation, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), and non-cardiac chest pain. Conservative treatment with proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole 40mg daily) and lifestyle modifications (dietary changes, weight loss, elevation of head of bed) for 6 months was unsuccessful in controlling symptoms. Patient experienced progressive worsening with dysphagia to solids raising concern for complications such as Barrett's esophagus, esophageal stricture, or malignancy.

On August 22, 2024, patient underwent diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy - EGD) with biopsies at American Health Endoscopy Center. Procedure performed under conscious sedation (monitored anesthesia care). Endoscopic findings revealed moderate esophagitis with erosions but no Barrett's esophagus, strictures, or masses. Multiple biopsies taken from esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, and stomach for histopathologic evaluation.

Pathology results (available August 25, 2024) showed chronic inflammation consistent with GERD, intestinal metaplasia absent, no dysplasia, and negative for Helicobacter pylori. Patient tolerated procedure well without complications. Discharged home same day with medication adjustments and dietary recommendations.
