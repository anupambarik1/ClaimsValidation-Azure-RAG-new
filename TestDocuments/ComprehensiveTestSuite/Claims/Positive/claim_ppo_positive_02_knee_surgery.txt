DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:
Patient Sarah Martinez sustained a displaced fracture of the right patella (kneecap) on September 5, 2024, after falling from her bicycle during recreational riding. Initial emergency department evaluation and X-rays confirmed a comminuted patellar fracture with significant displacement. Conservative treatment (casting) was deemed inappropriate due to the nature of the fracture. Patient was referred to orthopedic surgery.

On September 8, 2024, patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of right patellar fracture at Liberty Orthopedic Center (in-network facility). Surgery performed by Dr. James Mitchell, orthopedic surgeon. Procedure involved surgical incision, fracture reduction, and placement of internal fixation hardware (tension band wiring technique with K-wires and cerclage wire).

Surgery was performed under general anesthesia and lasted approximately 2 hours. Patient tolerated procedure well. Post-operative course was uncomplicated. Patient remained hospitalized for 2 days for pain management, wound monitoring, and physical therapy consultation. Discharged home on September 10, 2024, with crutches, pain medication, and physical therapy prescription. Follow-up scheduled.
