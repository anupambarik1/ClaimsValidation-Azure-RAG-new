2. Test if system identifies policy matches correctly
3. Verify deductible/coinsurance math
4. Check if pre-authorization is validated
5. Confirm medical necessity assessment

FOR API TESTING:
1. POST /api/claims/validate with claim forms
2. POST /api/documents/upload with supporting docs
3. Verify document extraction accuracy
4. Test multi-document claims processing
5. Validate claim status determination logic
