4. Describe in detail the events leading to death:

On the evening of Saturday, November 2, 2024, my wife Jennifer and I were at home. We had dinner around 6:30 PM and were relaxing watching television in our living room.

At approximately 8:30 PM, Jennifer suddenly grabbed her chest and said she was experiencing severe chest pain. She described it as a crushing pressure in the center of her chest that radiated to her left arm and jaw. She was also having difficulty breathing, was sweating profusely, and said she felt nauseated.

I immediately recognized these as potential heart attack symptoms. I helped her sit down on the couch and called 911 at 8:45 PM. The 911 operator instructed me to have her chew an aspirin if available, which I gave her, and to stay on the line until paramedics arrived.

Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at approximately 8:52 PM. The paramedics assessed Jennifer, took her vital signs, placed her on oxygen, started an IV, and performed an EKG. They informed me they suspected she was having a heart attack and needed immediate transport to Memorial Hospital.

Jennifer was transported by ambulance at approximately 9:05 PM. I followed in my car and arrived at the emergency department shortly after the ambulance at about 9:15 PM.

At the hospital, Jennifer was taken immediately to the emergency room. The emergency physician and a cardiologist (Dr. Robert Hayes) evaluated her. They confirmed she was having a major heart attack (STEMI) and said she needed emergency cardiac catheterization.

Jennifer was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab around 9:45 PM. I was not allowed in the procedure room. Dr. Hayes came out periodically to update me. He said they found a severe blockage in one of her main heart arteries and were attempting to open it.

At approximately 11:45 PM, a nurse came to get me and said there were complications and Dr. Hayes wanted to speak with me. Dr. Hayes informed me that during the procedure, Jennifer's heart had gone into a dangerous rhythm (ventricular fibrillation) and they were performing CPR and trying to resuscitate her.

Medical staff worked on Jennifer for nearly an hour. At 12:18 AM on November 3rd, Dr. Hayes came to tell me they had done everything possible but were unable to save her. My wife was pronounced dead at 12:18 AM.

5. Had the insured been under a physician's care before death?
☑ NO ☐ YES

To the best of my knowledge, Jennifer was not under treatment for any heart condition or other serious illness. She saw her primary care doctor (Dr. Susan Chen) for routine annual checkups but had no ongoing medical problems that I was aware of.

6. What was the insured's general state of health before death?
Jennifer appeared to be in good health. She was active, worked full-time as an elementary school teacher, exercised regularly (walking, yoga), maintained a healthy weight, did not smoke, and had no known medical problems. This heart attack was completely unexpected.

7. Were there any warning signs or symptoms before the fatal event?
No. Jennifer had no prior episodes of chest pain, shortness of breath, or other cardiac symptoms that I was aware of. The event on November 2nd was sudden and without any warning.
