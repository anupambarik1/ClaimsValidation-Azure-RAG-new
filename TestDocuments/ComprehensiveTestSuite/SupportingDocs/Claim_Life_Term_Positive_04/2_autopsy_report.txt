MEDICAL EXAMINER: Dr. Patricia Morgan, MD
Board Certified: Anatomic and Forensic Pathology
License: IL-MD-98765

EXTERNAL EXAMINATION:
The body is that of a well-developed, well-nourished adult white female measuring 66 inches (167 cm) in length and weighing 145 pounds (65.8 kg). Body is cold to touch, consistent with refrigeration. Rigor mortis fully developed. Livor mortis posterior, fixed, consistent with supine position. No evidence of trauma.

Identifying Features: Brown hair, brown eyes. No tattoos. Wedding ring on left ring finger.

Medical Intervention: Fresh median sternotomy incision present from recent CPR efforts at hospital. Multiple needle punctures on arms consistent with IV access. Subcutaneous defibrillator pad marks on chest.

INTERNAL EXAMINATION:

CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:
Heart weight: 320 grams (normal: 250-300g for adult female - mildly enlarged)

Coronary Arteries: Severe atherosclerotic disease present
- Left Main Coronary: 30% stenosis
- Left Anterior Descending (LAD): 95% stenosis at proximal segment with acute occlusive thrombus (blood clot) at site of maximum stenosis
- Left Circumflex: 40% stenosis  
- Right Coronary Artery: 50% stenosis

Myocardium: Acute myocardial infarction present in anterior and anteroseptal walls of left ventricle. Fresh infarct with coagulation necrosis, measuring approximately 4 x 3 cm. No evidence of old (healed) myocardial infarcts.

Valves: All four cardiac valves grossly normal, no vegetations or pathology
Chambers: Left ventricle wall thickness normal. No chamber dilation.
Pericardium: No fluid, no adhesions

RESPIRATORY SYSTEM:
Lungs: Combined weight 950 grams. Mild pulmonary edema (fluid) consistent with cardiac failure. No pneumonia, no emboli.
Airways: Patent, no foreign material

GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:
Stomach: Contains approximately 200 mL partially digested food. No evidence of bleeding.
Intestines: Grossly normal
Liver: Weight 1,450 grams, normal size and architecture. No cirrhosis.
Pancreas, Spleen, Gallbladder: All grossly normal

GENITOURINARY SYSTEM:
Kidneys: Combined weight 280 grams, normal size. No pathology noted.
Bladder: Empty. No pathology.

CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM:
Brain: Weight 1,350 grams (normal). No hemorrhage, no trauma. No masses or lesions.

ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:
Thyroid: Normal size and appearance
Adrenals: Normal

MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM:
No fractures. No trauma.

TOXICOLOGY:
Blood Alcohol: Negative (0.00%)
Drugs of Abuse Screen: Negative for cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids
Therapeutic Drugs: Trace levels of midazolam and fentanyl (consistent with hospital emergency treatment)
Carbon Monoxide: Negative
Cyanide: Negative

HISTOLOGY (Microscopic Examination):
Sections from heart show acute myocardial infarction with coagulation necrosis, neutrophilic infiltration, and loss of normal myocardial architecture in affected area. Coronary artery sections confirm severe atherosclerosis with acute thrombotic occlusion of LAD. No evidence of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), anteroseptal left ventricle
2. Severe atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with acute thrombotic occlusion of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (95% stenosis with superimposed thrombus)
3. Mild cardiomegaly (enlarged heart)
4. Pulmonary edema (fluid in lungs) secondary to cardiac failure
5. Status post cardiopulmonary resuscitation (sternotomy incision)

CAUSE OF DEATH:
Acute myocardial infarction due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with acute coronary thrombosis

MANNER OF DEATH: NATURAL

OPINION:
Jennifer Anne Williams, a 42-year-old female, died of natural causes, specifically acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) caused by severe coronary artery disease with acute blood clot in the left anterior descending coronary artery. 

The autopsy findings are entirely consistent with sudden cardiac death from acute coronary syndrome. The degree of atherosclerosis and the acute thrombotic occlusion explain the fatal outcome despite emergency medical intervention.

There is no evidence of trauma, foul play, suicide, or accidental death. The toxicology is negative for drugs or alcohol. The manner of death is natural.

This was an unfortunate case of sudden cardiac death in a relatively young individual with undiagnosed coronary artery disease. Such cases can occur without prior symptoms, particularly in women who may have atypical presentations of cardiac disease.

INVESTIGATIVE SUMMARY:
Decedent collapsed at home with chest pain on evening of November 2, 2024. Emergency services called. Transported to Memorial Hospital where she was diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Underwent emergency cardiac catheterization which confirmed severe LAD occlusion. Despite intervention and prolonged resuscitation, she died in the cardiac catheterization lab at 12:18 AM on November 3, 2024.

AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE:
This autopsy was performed at the request of the Sangamon County Coroner due to sudden unexpected death. Body released to Springfield Memorial Funeral Home on November 5, 2024.
