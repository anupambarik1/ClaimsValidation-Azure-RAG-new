   - Supported by elevated WBC (18,500) with left shift
   - Clinical presentation consistent with bacterial pneumonia

3. Fever secondary to pneumonia (R50.9)
4. Acute cough (R05)
5. Pleuritic chest pain (R07.1)

CHRONIC CONDITIONS:

HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY:
==============================================================================

PRESENTATION:
Mr. Michael Thompson is a 46-year-old male with history of hypertension who presented to the City Medical Center Emergency Department on October 15, 2024 with a 4-day history of progressive respiratory symptoms. Chief complaints included productive cough with purulent sputum, high fever (measured at home up to 103°F), shortness of breath, and right-sided pleuritic chest pain.

INITIAL ASSESSMENT:
Upon arrival at 18:45, patient appeared ill and was in moderate respiratory distress. Initial vital signs were concerning:
- Temperature: 103.2°F (significant fever)
- Heart Rate: 118 bpm (tachycardia)
- Respiratory Rate: 28 breaths/minute (tachypnea)
- Oxygen Saturation: 89% on room air (hypoxemia)
- Blood Pressure: 145/88 mmHg (elevated, likely due to pain/stress)

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS:
- Respiratory: Decreased breath sounds right lower lobe, crackles on auscultation, dullness to percussion
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic but regular rhythm
- General: Ill-appearing, diaphoretic, speaking in short sentences

DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP:

Chest X-Ray (PA and Lateral - 19:15):
- Right lower lobe consolidation approximately 8 x 6 cm
- Air bronchograms present
- Consistent with lobar pneumonia
- No pleural effusion or pneumothorax

Laboratory Studies (19:00):
- WBC: 18.5 x10³/μL (markedly elevated)
- Neutrophils: 82% with left shift
- Absolute neutrophil count: 15,170/μL
- Hemoglobin and platelets: Normal
- Blood cultures: Drawn (2 sets), preliminary negative

ASSESSMENT:
Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), right lower lobe, likely bacterial etiology based on:
- Acute onset with productive cough and high fever
- Lobar consolidation on imaging
- Elevated WBC with left shift indicating bacterial infection
- Clinical severity (hypoxemia, tachypnea, tachycardia)

TREATMENT PROVIDED IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT:

Oxygen Therapy:
- Initiated 2L via nasal cannula
- Oxygen saturation improved from 89% to 95%
- Continued throughout ED stay

Intravenous Access:
- 18-gauge IV catheter placed in left antecubital vein
- Normal saline 1000mL IV bolus administered for hydration

Antibiotic Therapy (Initiated in ED):
- Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV at 19:30 (broad-spectrum coverage)
- Azithromycin 500mg PO at 19:45 (atypical coverage)
- Rationale: Empiric therapy for community-acquired pneumonia per IDSA/ATS guidelines

Antipyretic Therapy:
- Acetaminophen 1000mg PO at 20:00
- Temperature decreased from 103.2°F to 100.8°F by discharge

Monitoring:
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Cardiac monitoring (due to tachycardia)
- Serial vital sign assessments every hour

CLINICAL RESPONSE:
Patient demonstrated good response to therapy:
- Improved respiratory status (RR decreased from 28 to 20)
- Oxygen saturation maintained at 96% on 2L
- Fever curve trending down
- Tachycardia resolved (HR decreased to 98 bpm)
- Patient able to ambulate without distress
- Tolerating oral intake and medications

DISPOSITION DECISION:
Based on clinical improvement, hemodynamic stability, and ability to tolerate oral antibiotics, patient deemed appropriate for outpatient management. CURB-65 score calculated: 0 points (low risk, suitable for outpatient treatment).

CURB-65 Scoring:
- Confusion: No (0 points)
- Urea: Not checked, but patient well-hydrated
- Respiratory Rate: 20 at discharge (<30) (0 points)
- Blood Pressure: Stable (0 points)
- Age: 46 years (<65) (0 points)
Total: 0 points = Low risk, outpatient treatment appropriate

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Improved, stable for home care
