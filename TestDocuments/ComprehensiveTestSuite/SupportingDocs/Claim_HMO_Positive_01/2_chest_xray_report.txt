Exam Date: October 15, 2024
Exam Time: 19:15 (7:15 PM)
Accession Number: RAD-2024-10158945
Ordering Physician: Dr. Sarah Anderson, MD (Emergency Medicine)
Exam Location: Emergency Department
Priority: STAT (Emergency)

EXAMINATION: Chest Radiograph, PA and Lateral Views

CLINICAL INDICATION:
Cough, fever, shortness of breath, chest pain. Rule out pneumonia.

COMPARISON:
None available. No prior chest imaging on file.

TECHNIQUE:
Standard posteroanterior (PA) and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained with the patient in standing position in the emergency department radiology suite. Adequate inspiration and positioning. No motion artifact.

Technical Factors:
- KVP: 110
- mAs: 3.2
- Distance: 72 inches
- Exposure: Adequate penetration

FINDINGS:

LUNGS:
RIGHT LUNG:
- Right Lower Lobe: Dense consolidation/infiltrate present in the posterior and lateral segments of the right lower lobe. The infiltrate measures approximately 8 x 6 cm in greatest dimension. Air bronchograms are visible within the consolidated area, consistent with pneumonic process. Well-defined margins suggestive of lobar involvement.
- Right Middle Lobe: Clear, no infiltrates
- Right Upper Lobe: Clear, no infiltrates

LEFT LUNG:
- All lobes clear bilaterally
- No infiltrates, consolidation, or masses identified
- Lung volumes normal
- No interstitial markings or edema

PLEURAL SPACES:
- No pleural effusion on either side
- Costophrenic angles are sharp bilaterally
- No pleural thickening or plaques
- No pneumothorax

HEART AND MEDIASTINUM:
- Heart size is within normal limits
- Cardiothoracic ratio: 0.45 (normal <0.50)
- Mediastinal contours are normal
- No mediastinal widening
- Aortic knob normal in size and contour
- No hilar lymphadenopathy
- Trachea midline

BONY THORAX:
- Visualized thoracic spine shows normal alignment
- No acute fractures identified
- No lytic or blastic lesions
- Ribs intact bilaterally
- Clavicles and shoulder girdles unremarkable
- No osseous abnormalities

SOFT TISSUES:
- Soft tissues of the chest wall are unremarkable
- No subcutaneous emphysema
- No masses or abnormalities

VISIBLE UPPER ABDOMEN:
- No free air under diaphragm
- Liver edge normal
- Gastric bubble present and normal

IMPRESSION:

1. RIGHT LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA
   Dense consolidation in the right lower lobe with air bronchograms, measuring approximately 8 x 6 cm. Findings are consistent with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia involving the posterior and lateral segments of the right lower lobe.

2. NO PLEURAL EFFUSION
   Costophrenic angles are sharp bilaterally. No evidence of parapneumonic effusion.

3. NO PNEUMOTHORAX
   No evidence of pneumothorax. Lung fields are otherwise clear except for the described RLL infiltrate.

4. NORMAL HEART SIZE
   Cardiothoracic ratio within normal limits. No cardiomegaly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Clinical correlation recommended with patient symptoms and laboratory findings
2. Appropriate antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia
3. Follow-up chest radiograph recommended in 4-6 weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy to document resolution of pneumonia and exclude underlying mass or other abnormality
4. If symptoms worsen or fail to improve, consider CT chest for further evaluation

COMPARISON WITH CLINICAL HISTORY:
Radiographic findings are consistent with clinical presentation of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain. The right lower lobe pneumonia correlates with physical exam findings of decreased breath sounds and crackles in the right lower lung field.
