MANUAL DIFFERENTIAL NOTES:
Peripheral blood smear reviewed. Marked left shift observed with increased band forms (immature neutrophils) present, consistent with acute bacterial infection. Toxic granulation and Döhle bodies noted in neutrophils. No atypical lymphocytes. No blasts identified. RBC morphology normal. Platelets adequate and appear normal.

INTERPRETATION:
Marked leukocytosis (elevated WBC) with neutrophilia and left shift. Findings are highly suggestive of acute bacterial infection. The degree of elevation and presence of immature forms (bands) support the clinical diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia.

BLOOD CULTURE REPORT
==============================================================================

SPECIMEN COLLECTION:
Set 1 - Aerobic and Anaerobic
Collection Site: Left antecubital vein
Collection Time: 19:05
Collected By: Sarah Kim, RN
Volume: 10mL per bottle (adequate)

Set 2 - Aerobic and Anaerobic
Collection Site: Right antecubital vein
Collection Time: 19:10
Collected By: Sarah Kim, RN
Volume: 10mL per bottle (adequate)

TOTAL BOTTLES: 4 (2 aerobic, 2 anaerobic)

GRAM STAIN (Direct from blood):
No organisms visualized on direct Gram stain examination

CULTURE METHOD:
Automated continuous monitoring blood culture system
Incubation Temperature: 35°C
Monitoring: Continuous for 5 days

PRELIMINARY RESULTS (as of October 15, 2024 at 20:15):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bottle Status:
Set 1 - Aerobic:    No growth detected (12 hours)
Set 1 - Anaerobic:  No growth detected (12 hours)
Set 2 - Aerobic:    No growth detected (12 hours)
Set 2 - Anaerobic:  No growth detected (12 hours)

Current Status: ALL BOTTLES NEGATIVE at 12 hours
Cultures will be monitored for total of 5 days (120 hours)

FINAL RESULTS: Pending (will be available in 72-120 hours)

If bottles turn positive:
- Organism identification will be performed
- Antimicrobial susceptibility testing will be conducted
- Results will be called to ordering physician immediately

==============================================================================
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
==============================================================================

The complete blood count demonstrates significant leukocytosis (WBC 18,500) with marked neutrophilia (82%) and absolute neutrophil count of 15,170. The presence of left shift (increased immature neutrophils/bands) and toxic changes in neutrophils strongly supports acute bacterial infection.

These laboratory findings, in conjunction with the clinical presentation (fever, cough, shortness of breath) and radiographic evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia, are consistent with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.

Blood cultures are pending. Negative preliminary results do not exclude pneumonia, as blood cultures are positive in only 5-15% of community-acquired pneumonia cases. Continue empiric antibiotic therapy as clinically indicated.
