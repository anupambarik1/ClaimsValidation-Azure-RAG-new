HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Thompson is a 45-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a 4-day history of productive cough, high fever (103.2°F), shortness of breath, and pleuritic right-sided chest pain. 

Initial assessment revealed an ill-appearing patient in moderate respiratory distress with tachypnea (RR 28), tachycardia (HR 118), and hypoxemia (SpO2 89% on room air). Physical examination was significant for decreased breath sounds and crackles in the right lower lung field.

Patient responded well to treatment with improvement in respiratory status, oxygen saturation, and fever. By time of discharge, patient was maintaining SpO2 96% on 2L O2, respiratory rate decreased to 20, and temperature improved to 100.8°F.

Given clinical improvement and hemodynamic stability, patient deemed appropriate for outpatient management with oral antibiotics and close follow-up.

6. Follow up with primary care physician (Dr. James Wilson) within 2-3 days
