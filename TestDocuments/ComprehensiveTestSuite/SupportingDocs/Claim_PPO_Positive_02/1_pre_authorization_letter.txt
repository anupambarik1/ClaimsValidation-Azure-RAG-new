==============================================================================

Date of Clinical Review: September 6, 2024
Reviewed By: Dr. Patricia Reynolds, MD (Medical Director)
License: TX-MD-54321
Clinical Reviewer Specialty: Orthopedic Surgery

CLINICAL INFORMATION REVIEWED:
• Emergency department records from September 5, 2024
• X-ray images of right knee (2 views) dated September 5, 2024
• Radiology report confirming displaced comminuted patellar fracture
• Orthopedic consultation note from Dr. James Mitchell dated September 6, 2024
• Treatment plan and surgical recommendation

MEDICAL NECESSITY DETERMINATION:
The requested procedure - Open Reduction Internal Fixation of right patellar fracture - has been determined to be MEDICALLY NECESSARY based on the following criteria:

1. CLINICAL INDICATION: Patient sustained displaced comminuted fracture of right patella with significant displacement (>3mm) and intra-articular involvement.

2. CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT CONTRAINDICATED: Due to degree of displacement and comminution, non-operative treatment (casting/splinting) is unlikely to result in adequate healing and functional recovery.

3. STANDARD OF CARE: Operative fixation is the accepted standard of care for displaced patellar fractures to restore articular congruity and knee extensor mechanism function.

4. EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES: Request meets criteria from:
   - American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Clinical Practice Guidelines
   - Orthopedic Trauma Association (OTA) treatment recommendations
   - Liberty Choice PPO Medical Policy #ORTHO-245: Patellar Fracture Treatment

5. FUNCTIONAL NECESSITY: Without surgical intervention, patient faces high risk of:
   - Permanent loss of knee extension
   - Chronic pain
   - Post-traumatic arthritis
   - Significant functional disability
   - Inability to ambulate normally

6. PROVIDER QUALIFICATIONS: Dr. James Mitchell is board-certified orthopedic surgeon with extensive experience in patellar fracture repair (credentials verified).
