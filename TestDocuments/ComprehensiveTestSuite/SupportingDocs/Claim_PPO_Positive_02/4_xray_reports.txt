The patella demonstrates multiple fracture fragments with the following characteristics:
- Transverse fracture line through mid-patella
- Additional vertical fracture creating four main fragments
- Superior pole fragment: Displaced superiorly approximately 8mm
- Inferior pole fragment: Intact attachment to patellar tendon
- Two central fragments with intra-articular involvement

Fracture displacement: Approximately 8mm separation between superior and inferior poles
Articular surface: Disrupted with intra-articular step-off of approximately 3-4mm
Fracture edges: Irregular and comminuted

JOINT SPACE:
- Patellofemoral joint space: Obscured by fracture and hemarthrosis
- Tibiofemoral joint space: Appears preserved (medial and lateral compartments)
- No associated femoral condyle fractures
- No associated tibial plateau fractures

SOFT TISSUES:
- Moderate joint effusion (hemarthrosis) present
- Soft tissue swelling anterior to patella and suprapatellar region
- Quadriceps tendon appears intact (best assessed clinically)
- Patellar tendon appears intact (best assessed clinically)
- No subcutaneous emphysema
- No foreign bodies

ALIGNMENT:
- Overall lower extremity alignment maintained
- Patellar height: Difficult to assess due to fracture (estimated Insall-Salvati ratio cannot be accurately calculated)
- Femoral-tibial alignment: Normal, approximately 6 degrees valgus

OTHER FINDINGS:
- Femur: No fracture
- Tibia: No fracture
- Fibula: No fracture
- No degenerative changes noted
- No bone lesions
- Hardware: None present (pre-operative)

IMPRESSION:
1. Comminuted displaced fracture of right patella with approximately 8mm separation between superior and inferior poles, unchanged from prior examination on September 5, 2024.

2. Intra-articular involvement with articular step-off of 3-4mm.

3. Moderate hemarthrosis (joint effusion).

4. No associated fractures of femur, tibia, or fibula.

5. Patient scheduled for operative fixation today - appropriate indication for surgery given degree of displacement and intra-articular involvement.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Proceed with planned surgical intervention (ORIF).
Post-operative imaging recommended to confirm reduction and hardware placement.

- Final hardware position

Total fluoroscopy time: 4.2 minutes
Radiation exposure: 1.8 mGy (within acceptable limits for fluoroscopy)
Images saved to PACS for permanent record: 18 images

FINDINGS:
Fluoroscopic guidance used throughout procedure. Key findings documented:

1. Pre-reduction images confirmed pre-operative fracture pattern
2. Multiple images obtained during fracture reduction showing progressive alignment of fragments
3. K-wire placement: Two parallel K-wires placed longitudinally through patella
   - Excellent positioning in AP and lateral views
   - No intra-articular penetration
   - Good purchase in proximal and distal fragments
4. Cerclage wire: Figure-of-eight configuration confirmed
5. Final images: Anatomic reduction achieved with <2mm articular step-off

- Medial and lateral fragments: Well-aligned

INTERNAL FIXATION HARDWARE:
Two parallel 2.0mm stainless steel K-wires and one 18-gauge cerclage wire are present, forming a modified tension band construct:

K-WIRES:
- Two K-wires placed parallel to each other in longitudinal orientation
- K-wire #1: Medial position, excellent trajectory from inferior pole through superior pole
- K-wire #2: Lateral position, parallel to K-wire #1
- Proximal ends: Bent and buried to prevent migration
- Distal ends: Adequate purchase in inferior pole

- No cortical perforation
- Excellent positioning in all views

CERCLAGE WIRE:
- Figure-of-eight configuration clearly visualized
- Wire passes anterior to patella

- Patellar tilt: Normal (no lateral tilting)
- Femoral-tibial alignment: Normal

JOINT SPACES:
- Patellofemoral joint: Articular surfaces congruent
- Tibiofemoral joint: Normal medial and lateral compartment joint spaces
- No intra-articular loose bodies

SOFT TISSUES:

- No foreign bodies
- Knee immobilizer in place (partially visualized)

OTHER:
- Femur: Intact, no fracture
- Tibia: Intact, no fracture
- Fibula: Intact, no fracture

4. Restoration of normal patellar height (Insall-Salvati ratio 1.1).

5. No immediate post-operative complications identified.

6. Satisfactory surgical result.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Clinical follow-up with orthopedic surgeon as scheduled
