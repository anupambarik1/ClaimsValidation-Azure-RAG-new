Patient: Robert Chen | DOB: 3/15/1990 | Gender: M | MRN: AHEC-556677
Accession #: SP-2024-08-445678 | Received: 8/22/2024 | Reported: 8/25/2024
Ordering Physician: Dr. Emily Rodriguez, MD | NPI: 1564738291
Clinical History: GERD symptoms x 6 months, dysphagia. R/O Barrett's esophagus.

SPECIMENS:
A. Distal esophagus, biopsy (2 jars)
B. Gastroesophageal junction, biopsy (2 jars)
C. Stomach antrum, biopsy (2 jars)
D. Stomach body, biopsy (2 jars)

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A-D: Each specimen consists of multiple fragments of tan-pink soft tissue measuring 0.1-0.3cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted for microscopic examination.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

SPECIMEN A - DISTAL ESOPHAGUS:
The sections show squamous mucosa with reactive changes including basal cell hyperplasia, elongation of papillae, and scattered intraepithelial inflammatory cells (eosinophils 15-20 per high power field). Focal erosion with fibrinopurulent exudate present. Lamina propria shows chronic inflammation with lymphocytes and plasma cells.
- NO intestinal metaplasia (Barrett's esophagus)
- NO dysplasia
- NO malignancy

SPECIMEN B - GASTROESOPHAGEAL JUNCTION:
Sections show gastric cardia-type mucosa with mild chronic inflammation. Squamous epithelium shows reactive changes. Z-line architecture preserved.
- NO intestinal metaplasia
- NO specialized intestinal epithelium
- NO dysplasia
- NO malignancy

SPECIMEN C - STOMACH ANTRUM:
The sections show antral mucosa with mild to moderate chronic inflammation characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in lamina propria. Foveolar epithelium intact. No intestinal metaplasia.
- NO H. pylori organisms identified (Giemsa stain negative)
- NO atrophy
- NO intestinal metaplasia
- NO dysplasia or malignancy

SPECIMEN D - STOMACH BODY:
Sections show gastric body-type mucosa (oxyntic mucosa) with mild chronic inflammation. Parietal and chief cells present and normal.
- NO H. pylori organisms (Giemsa stain negative)
- NO atrophy
- NO intestinal metaplasia
- NO malignancy

ANCILLARY STUDIES:
Giemsa stain for H. pylori: NEGATIVE (Specimens C and D)

DIAGNOSIS:

A. DISTAL ESOPHAGUS, BIOPSY:
   - REFLUX ESOPHAGITIS, MODERATE (with basal cell hyperplasia, elongated papillae, intraepithelial eosinophils)
   - FOCAL EROSION
   - NO INTESTINAL METAPLASIA (NO BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS)

B. GASTROESOPHAGEAL JUNCTION, BIOPSY:
   - MILD CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
   - NO INTESTINAL METAPLASIA
   - NO SPECIALIZED COLUMNAR EPITHELIUM

C. STOMACH ANTRUM, BIOPSY:
   - CHRONIC GASTRITIS, MILD TO MODERATE
   - HELICOBACTER PYLORI: NOT IDENTIFIED

D. STOMACH BODY, BIOPSY:
   - MILD CHRONIC GASTRITIS
   - HELICOBACTER PYLORI: NOT IDENTIFIED

COMMENT:
The histologic findings are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). There is no evidence of Barrett's esophagus (intestinal metaplasia with goblet cells) in the examined tissue. The moderate reflux esophagitis with eosinophils correlates with clinical symptoms. No H. pylori infection identified. Continued medical management for GERD is appropriate.
