IMPRESSION

1. **ACUTE APPENDICITIS**
   - Distended appendix (12mm diameter)
   - Periappendiceal inflammation with fat stranding
   - Small amount of adjacent free fluid
   - Findings consistent with acute, uncomplicated appendicitis

2. No evidence of appendiceal perforation or abscess formation at this time

3. No alternative explanation for right lower quadrant pain identified

RECOMMENDATION
Urgent surgical consultation recommended for appendectomy.

CRITICAL RESULT NOTIFICATION
This finding was called to Dr. Michael Chen, ED attending physician, at 2:15 AM on January 11, 2024 by Dr. Amanda Foster.

ADDENDUM - LABORATORY CORRELATION

Reviewed concurrent laboratory values:
- WBC: 15,200/μL (elevated, consistent with acute inflammation)
- Urinalysis: Negative (helps exclude urinary tract pathology)

Clinical-radiologic correlation supports diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
