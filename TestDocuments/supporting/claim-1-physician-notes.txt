INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY
This is a 38-year-old female who presented to the Emergency Department with severe right lower quadrant pain, fever (101.8°F), and leukocytosis (WBC 15,200). CT scan revealed acute appendicitis with periappendiceal inflammation. Patient consented for urgent laparoscopic appendectomy after discussion of risks including bleeding, infection, injury to surrounding structures, conversion to open procedure, and possible need for extended bowel resection.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE
Patient brought to operating room and placed in supine position. General anesthesia induced by Dr. Wong without complication. Foley catheter placed. Abdomen prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.

A 12mm umbilical incision made and Veress needle inserted. Pneumoperitoneum established with CO2 to 15mmHg. 12mm trocar inserted under direct visualization. Camera inserted - initial inspection revealed inflammatory fluid in pelvis.

Two additional 5mm ports placed under direct visualization: one in left lower quadrant and one in suprapubic position. Systematic exploration performed.

INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:
- Inflamed, edematous appendix in retrocecal position
- Small perforation at tip of appendix (approximately 3mm)
- Approximately 20mL purulent fluid in periappendiceal region
- Small contained abscess around appendix tip
- No fecal contamination
- No other intra-abdominal pathology

PROCEDURE DETAILS:
Appendix mobilized from retrocecal position using gentle blunt and sharp dissection. Mesoappendix divided using LigaSure device with excellent hemostasis. Appendiceal base identified at junction with cecum.

Purulent fluid aspirated using suction. Base of appendix cleared circumferentially. Two Endoloop sutures placed at base of appendix, tied securely. Appendix divided distal to ligatures using cautery scissors. Appendiceal stump inspected - hemostasis adequate, stump appearance satisfactory.

Specimen placed in retrieval bag and removed through umbilical port. Peritoneal cavity irrigated with 2 liters warm normal saline until return clear. All fluid aspirated. Hemostasis confirmed. No drains placed as contamination minimal and well-controlled.

All ports removed under direct visualization. Fascia at umbilical port closed with 0-Vicryl figure-of-eight suture. Skin incisions closed with 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures. Steri-strips and sterile dressings applied.

Patient tolerated procedure well. Transferred to PACU in stable condition. Specimens sent to pathology.

PLAN
- IV antibiotics: Continue Ceftriaxone and add Metronidazole
- Pain control: Dilaudid PCA
- Diet: NPO tonight, advance to clears tomorrow if tolerating
- Activity: Ambulate tonight with assistance
- Monitor for signs of infection or complications
- Anticipated discharge in 48-72 hours if uncomplicated recovery
